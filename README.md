**Summary of the Project**
The Corner Grocer project is an item-tracking program that utilizes C++ to accomplish the following requirements:

    Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
    Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
    Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.

The project was designed to handle all functionality within C++, including reading and writing files.

**What was done well**
The overall project was implemented in a way that properly incorporated the requested functionality to meet all requirements. This was achieved 
by creating well-structured functions in C++, which helped to keep the main code in main() concise and easy to follow.

**Areas for Improvement**
With more time and practice, the project could be further enhanced by creating classes and improving the function structure. 
This would make the code even more efficient, readable, and adaptable for future changes.

**Challenges Faced**
There were a couple of challenges faced during this project. First, I found out the hard way that there was a typo in my FileIO routines, it still compiled just
fine however, no data was translated to the map utilized to keep track of the items and their count. Additionally, I wanted to employ pointers in the buiild but
this is a topic that I did not think was necessary to make this functional and would have added complexity without any real benefit.

**Transferable Skills**
The most valuable skill gained from this project was learning how to handle file I/O operations in C++, which is a widely applicable skill. Also the use of maps
to maintain an in memory data table is something that can be used in many applications.

**Maintaining Readability and Adaptability**
The program was made more maintainable, readable, and adaptable by:

    Creating well-structured functions in C++.
    Adding clear and detailed comments throughout the code.

These practices help to ensure the code can be easily understood, modified, and extended in the future.
